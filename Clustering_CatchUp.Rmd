### K-Means Clustering

```{r}

# Run k-means for k = centers = 3
set.seed(253)
kclust_k3 <- kmeans(wine, centers = 3)

# Display the cluter assignments
kclust_k3$cluster

# Add a variable (kclust_3) to the original dataset 
# containing the cluster assignments
wine <- wine %>%
    mutate(kclust_3 = factor(kclust_k3$cluster))
```

```{r}
# Look at summary statistics of the 3 variables
summary(wine)

# Perform clustering: should you use scale()?
set.seed(253)
kclust_k3_3vars <- kmeans(scale(wine), centers = 3)

wine <- wine %>%
    mutate(kclust_3_3vars = factor(kclust_k3_3vars$cluster))
```
