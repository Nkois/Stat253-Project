### K-Means Clustering


```{r}
# Look at summary statistics of the 3 variables
summary(wine)

# Perform clustering: should you use scale()?
set.seed(253)
kclust_k3_3vars <- kmeans(scale(wine), centers = 3)

wine_sub2 <- wine %>%
    mutate(kclust_3_3vars = factor(kclust_k3_3vars$cluster))

#can type out more variables if you want to see
wine_sub2 %>%
    group_by(kclust_3_3vars) %>%
    summarize(across(c(Alcohol, Malic_Acid, Ash, Ash_Alcanity), mean))
```
```{r}
#vizualizing two random variables
ggplot(wine_sub2, aes(y=Alcohol, x=Malic_Acid, color=kclust_3_3vars)) +
    geom_point()
```
